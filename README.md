# Predictive-Maintenance-of-Industrial-Machinery
A Machine Learning project built using IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI to predict machinery failure types from sensor data. It automates model selection, tuning, and feature engineering to support proactive maintenance in industrial settings.

## üìù Project Overview

**Predictive Maintenance** aims to anticipate machine failures before they occur, allowing maintenance teams to take proactive steps that reduce downtime and repair costs. This project analyzes real-time sensor data from industrial machines and builds a machine learning classification model to predict different types of potential failures such as:

- Tool wear
- Power failure
- Heat dissipation issues

## üéØ Objective

To develop a predictive model using machine learning that:
- Analyzes historical and real-time machine sensor data
- Identifies failure patterns before they happen
- Predicts the failure type (multi-class classification)
- Helps in scheduling proactive maintenance to optimize machine uptime
